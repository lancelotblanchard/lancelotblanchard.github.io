The product we developed allows DJs to create sessions and invite any number of people to join them and mix tracks together. The product also offers the ability of streaming a live session to *Youtube* or *Twitch*.\n\nThis project came as a potential response to the global ban of Live Music during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Such a technology had *never been seen before in the Music Technology industry* and I was very thrilled to develop such an innovation for an Industry that I genuinely enjoy. Among the features offered by DJStreamr were also other innovations such as *Cloud-Based track management*.\n\nAs part of our market research, we received very positive feedback and drew the interest of DJ Label *DEFECTED* and the Music Technology Company *Native Instruments*. The product has also been used by *Imperial College DJ & Production Society* at the start of the Autumn Term of 2020/2021, as a way of doing their usual *DJ Tutoring Sessions* remotely to comply with the College safety guidelines.\n\nThe product uses *Vue* with *Typescript* on the Frontend, in order to provide a simple DJ Client and to apply our Synchronisation Protocol. We use *AWS* on the Backend with *API Gateways* and *Lambdas* developed in Kotlin.

After we determined the position of all the pieces, we communicated with an *AlphaZero* instance runnning on *SingularityNET*, a decentralised network of AIs running on the *Ethereum* blockchain.\n\nThe project was awarded the *Most Interesting Extension Prize* and ranked 2nd best project overall.

We made sure of running the algorithm several times a week, in order to monitor the evolution of the position of tracks in the playlist over time.\n\nWe then used *R* to analyse the data and find correlations between track peak positions, the duration of their stay in the playlist and specific music properties we chose. Those properties included Key and Tempo, but also Spotify’s own *Audio Feature* parameters.\n\nThe project received the highest mark _(20/20)_.

As part of this research, we exchanged with several Researchers specialised in this field, from the *University of Rennes 1*, the *University of McGill* and the *Massachussets Institute of Technology*. The result of our study was presented as part of a magazine we designed and printed.\n\nThe *Software Engineering* aspect of this project was the **Web-App Survey** that I designed and developed for the purpose of this study. The survey required users to listen to a specific piece of music and to input keywords corresponding to their feelings in reaction to this piece of music. The survey was developed in *Javascript* and communicated with a *PHP Server* deployed on *Heroku*. We collected more than 1,400 answers that we then had to analyse in order to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of Music on people's emotions.\n\nWe were awarded the highest mark _(20/20)_ for this project.
