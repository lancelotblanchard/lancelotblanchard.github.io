                  <p>I am currently in the third year of a Masters of Engineering degree in
                    Computing at Imperial College London. I have always been fascinated by Computer
                    Science. I started learning C online at the age of ten and Java at the age of
                    twelve, and I have since then never stopped exploring and building applications
                    using these languages. I therefore naturally chose to study Computing after high
                    school and entered Imperial College London where I was granted an Entrance
                    Scholarship for best application and was featured on the Dean's List at the end
                    of my Second Year. I have always wanted to work in this area and to practise
                    my passion in an innovative environment.</p>

                  <p>Aside from Computing, I have always been passionate about music. In addition
                    to my engineering studies, I graduated from the French conservatory where I
                    studied classical piano and music theory for twelve years. I have composed and
                    performed with musicians in a variety of genres and formats. I am now involved
                    in several bands, for which I am producing and using my data analysis knowledge
                    to understand our statistics and optimise the audience. I am also managing my
                    Universityâ€™s Recording Studio and leading group workshops to teach students
                    how to use the facilities.
